"""
A Caesar cipher encrypter/decrypter.

"The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known
encryption techniques used in cryptography. It is a type of
substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by
a letter some fixed number of positions along the alphabet. For example,
with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and
so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his
private correspondence."

(Extracted from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
        
Example with a left shift of 3 (key=-3):
    'Hello, world!' → 'Ebiil, tloia!'
    'This is an English sentence.' → 'Qefp fp xk Bkdifpe pbkqbkzb.'
